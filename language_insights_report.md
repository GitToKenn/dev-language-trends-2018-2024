# 1. Executive Summary

This analysis explores how programming language usage has evolved over the last seven years, based on developer responses from the **Stack Overflow Annual Survey (2018‚Äì2024)**. By examining both **usage counts** and **percentage mentions**, the project aims to uncover macro trends across the ecosystem‚Äîhighlighting which languages are **gaining traction**, which are **stabilising**, and which are in **decline**.

### **Core Objectives**
- **Identify** the top programming languages used each year  
- **Detect** emerging and *‚Äúfossilised‚Äù* languages (i.e., those rising or fading in relevance)  
- **Evaluate** the long-term stability or volatility of language preferences  
- **Contextualise** these trends for real-world analytics and tooling decisions  

---

Notably, the **SAS anomaly** reveals a compelling micro-trend: a sudden emergence in **2022**, followed by an immediate drop in **2024**. This pattern aligns with broader conversations around industry demand for **enterprise-grade analytics**, and reflects my own exposure to SAS during an **exchange programme** in 2023. It serves as a reminder that niche tools can briefly surface when driven by institutional or curriculum shifts.

This project was both an **analytical exercise** and a **visual storytelling challenge**‚Äîintended to sharpen my exploratory data skills while demonstrating the ability to synthesise multi-year trends into **actionable insights**.

Each chart includes a **dedicated commentary**, and **colour consistency** is maintained across all visuals to ensure clarity, cohesion, and ease of interpretation.

  <img src="chart/chart_09_python_sql_vs_r_trends_2025-06-20_13-56-21.png" width="1000">
</div>

### üß† **Analytical Tools: Python & SQL Rise, While R Declines**

- Python and SQL show a consistent upward trend from **2018 to 2024**, reinforcing their dominance in modern data workflows. Both languages serve as foundational tools for data analysis and automation, likely benefiting from broader adoption in business and tech environments.

- In contrast, **R** demonstrates a **steady decline** over the same period. Once prominent in academic and statistical research, its waning usage suggests a shift toward more general-purpose and industry-integrated alternatives.

- *It is worth noting that the Stack Overflow survey reflects trends among developers*, which may not fully capture **R's continued presence in academic and specialist domains** such as epidemiology, econometrics, or statistical modelling.

- This divergence highlights a clear evolution in analyst tool preferences‚Äîwhere **Python and SQL now serve as standard** in enterprise and open-source ecosystems, while **R's role becomes more niche and research-oriented**.
 
*As an aspiring analyst, this affirms my decision to focus on Python + SQL while still acknowledging R‚Äôs academic legacy.*

### üìâ Emergence and Decline of SAS (2018‚Äì2024)

SAS exhibits a stark surge in developer mentions in 2022, followed by a rapid disappearance by 2024. Notably, there are zero entries for 2018‚Äì2021 and again in 2024, indicating it fell outside the top-ranking languages in those years based on survey responses.

While the Stack Overflow dataset highlights gaps in SAS responses‚Äîparticularly its absence in 2018‚Äì2021 and 2024‚Äîthis does not imply a decline in its real-world relevance. SAS remains a powerful tool in enterprise-level and financial analytics, especially in Southeast Asia.

For instance, [UniKL Business School](https://bis.unikl.edu.my/teachingfactories/) in Malaysia integrates SAS into its corporate finance curriculum through its Teaching Factory model. During my exchange programme, I participated in this course and its module and earned a [SAS certification](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syifa-alia-balqis/details/certifications/1726123424570/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADnQ7pMBVWGhjXpj9_dswWCCHQQgDVd7MLo), further deepening my exposure to advanced analytical tools beyond Python and SQL.

Since this is a developer-focused survey, it may not fully reflect seasonal or institutional adoption in sectors like banking or academic programs. The 2022 spike could indicate curriculum-driven usage or targeted institutional adoption, rather than broader community trends.

**Takeaway**: SAS may not appear consistently in public survey rankings, but its niche adoption‚Äîparticularly in specialized sectors‚Äîis still significant and context-dependent.

# 3. Key Takeaways

- **JavaScript** remains the most widely used programming language from 2018‚Äì2024, maintaining its lead in both developer count and mention percentage.

- **Python** and **SQL** have steadily gained ground over the years, reflecting their increasing relevance in data-related roles and backend development.

- **HTML/CSS** continues to hold a strong middle position, highlighting its foundational role in front-end development.

- **Java** shows a clear downward trend in both usage and ranking, suggesting its declining presence among newer developers or evolving industry preferences.

- **TypeScript** has emerged as a growing contender, with a noticeable rise in adoption, likely tied to JavaScript‚Äôs ecosystem and the push for type-safe code.

- **C and C++** maintain modest but stable positions, likely due to their continued role in systems programming, though not significantly rising in popularity.

- **R** shows a consistent decline over the years, which may reflect a shift in the data community toward Python and other analytics tools.

- Several legacy or niche languages‚Äîsuch as **Visual Basic**, **Objective-C**, and **Perl**‚Äîhave seen marked declines or fossilisation, often dropping below 0.5% in mentions by 2024.

- The overall trend suggests a **consolidation of skills** toward a few key multipurpose languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, SQL), while more specialised or academic tools decline in general developer usage.

- There is also a clear **plateauing effect** across many top languages in recent years, signalling maturity in the ecosystem rather than constant disruption.

These findings provide a holistic view of how language preferences are evolving‚Äînot just what‚Äôs popular, but what‚Äôs rising, stabilising, or quietly fading out of the mainstream.


# 4. Challenges Faced (include in appendix or inline)

---

### üß© **Challenge & Resolution**

This project involved analysing the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey (2018‚Äì2024)**, comprising over **2.7 million entries** after transformation. The aim was to uncover long-term programming language trends using Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`) in a Jupyter Notebook, with all work tracked via **Git version control**.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **The Challenge**  
The `LanguageWorkedWith` column stored multiple programming languages as a **semicolon-separated string**. In the **2018 dataset**, **HTML** and **CSS** were listed as separate entries, unlike later years that grouped them as **"HTML/CSS"**.

During preprocessing, I observed that developers who selected **CSS** almost always also selected **HTML** ‚Äî a consistent behavioural pattern across entries.  This widespread co-selection likely contributed to Stack Overflow's decision to merge them into a single **‚ÄúHTML/CSS‚Äù** category starting in 2019, reflecting how these technologies are typically used together in practice. \
‚û°Ô∏è Exploding these responses without adjustment caused **inflated counts** and **inconsistencies** compared to later years, due to double-counting.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è **The Solution**  
To address this:

- Introduced a **targeted pre-processing step** to unify representation.
- Applied a conditional `.apply()` mapping: whenever both `HTML` and `CSS` were selected, they were replaced with a single **‚ÄúHTML/CSS‚Äù** entry.
- Used a **dedicated Git branch** to safely experiment with alternative cleaning strategies and validate results before merging into the main workflow.

This preserved consistency across years and avoided inflated results during aggregation.

---

#### ‚úÖ **The Outcome**  
Post-cleaning and transformation:

- Final dataset included **2.7M+ language‚Äìrespondent entries** across all years.
- Enabled accurate year-over-year trend visualisation through:
  - üìä *Top 10 Languages in 2024* ‚Äî showcasing dominant languages.
  - üìà *Top 5 Trend Lines (2018‚Äì2024)* ‚Äî capturing Python‚Äôs rise and SQL‚Äôs stability.
  - üìâ *Declining Languages* ‚Äî spotlighting SAS, Perl, Visual Basic, Objective-C, and Assembly.

---

üí° *This project honed my ability to handle multi-valued categorical data, apply conditional logic for edge cases, and maintain version-safe development using Git ‚Äî all essential skills for real-world analytical workflows.*
